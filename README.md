## Overview

The original assignment for this, [Pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org/) project was to build a simple full stack budgeting app called Budgtr, where a user could log their financial transactions. This version uses the t3 stack (save for oAuth) to test out new features unrealated to the assignment.
